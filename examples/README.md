# Examples

Each of these example directories focuses on a particular way of using this library.
Some of them can be mix-n-matched.

We're using `"under-the-sun": "file:../.."` in the `package.json` dependencies of each of these
to keep them perfectly in sync with the parent repository,
but you'll want to use something more like `"under-the-sun": "^1.0.0"` in yours.
